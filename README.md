# Lucio.py
A basic discord music bot that I've created with discord.py and other libs.

In order to use this bot first you need to create an app in Discord Developer Portal and get your token.
After you got your token create a dotenv file and write this:

DISCORD_TOKEN = your_discord_token 

And save it.

I used ffmpeg to create audio from videos so you need to install it as well to your local machine.
After installing though ffmpeg may not appear in PATH so be sure to check it and add it if it's missing.

You also gonna need discord.py, python-dotenv and yt-dlp

You can install them in one line 

Just write or copy this to your terminal:

pip install discord.py python-dotenv yt-dlp

After you are done with every step you are good to run the bot.

Have fun!
